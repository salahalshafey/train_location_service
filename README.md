# Train GPS



## A Flutter project is mainly used for 
* Getting the current `train station` of the user **Riding a train**.
* Getting `Next Station`.
* Getting the `time` or `distance` remaining to the next station.
* Also getting the `Speed` of the train.
* This Feature currently working with `Cairo-Alex` Line in **Egypt**.


## How achieving the above
 * Using [location](https://pub.dev/packages/location) plugin for getting The location `Stream`.
 * By Saving all the `train station` `Latitude and Longitude` of the `Cairo-Alex` Line in **Egypt**.
 * And then Handling the logic of getting the above features.
